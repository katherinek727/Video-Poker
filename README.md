## 1. Introduction
***The iconic Vegas classic, now available on all of your devices!***

This game is a simple, web-based version of the classic video poker game, Jacks-or-Better. The objective of the game is to get at least a pair of jacks in your hand, and win credits based on the payout table.

Among all the games of chance, Video Poker stood out to me as something unique—where strategy met luck in a perfect balance. Unlike other casino games, Video Poker challenges the player to make the best decisions while leaving just enough to fate.

As a beginner programmer, it felt natural to bring this iconic game to life in a way that mimics the feeling of the Vegas classic. I chose to recreate this classic in a way that would have everyone experience a similar excitement.
